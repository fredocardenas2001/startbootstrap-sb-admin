The EPC Contractor shall provide and maintain all such guard lights and other protection for the public as may be required by applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations or by local conditions. EPC Contractor shall develop and shall provide to Owner within 15 days of the date this EPC Contract is executed by the parties hereto an environmental and health and safety program document describing EPC Contractor\u2019s applicable safety measures and shall comply with and shall cause its subcontractors to comply with such measures in the performance of the Work.\n\nSafety. The EPC Contractor shall perform and shall cause the subcontractors to perform the\n\n3.15 No Liens. Provided that Owner shall not be in default due to non-payment, the EPC Contractor shall within ten (10) days of notice pay, dissolve or bond off any lien or encumbrance on the Project, the Host Site, any other Project or equipment located on the Host Site or any component thereof or interest therein by any subcontractor, vendor, or other party claiming by or through EPC Contractor for labor, materials, supplies or other charges which, if unpaid, might be or become a lien upon the Project, the Host Site, or any component thereof. The EPC Contractor shall immediately notify Owner of the assertion of any lien or encumbrance asserted upon the Project, the Host Site, or any component thereof or any interest therein. Upon the failure of the EPC Contractor promptly to pay, dissolve or bond off any lien or encumbrance as required hereby, Owner may pay or bond off such lien or encumbrance and immediately recover the expenses incurred by it in connection with such payment or discharge from the EPC Contractor or set off such expenses against any sums owed by Owner to the EPC Contractor.\n\n3.16 Timely Performance. Time is of the essence in this EPC Contract. If the EPC Contractor shall fail to satisfy the conditions precedent for Substantial Completion set forth in Section 6.5 on or before the Scheduled Completion Date (as such may be extended from time to time pursuant to the terms of this EPC Contract) for any reason other than delay caused by (a) Owner's material breach of its obligations hereunder, or (b) any Force Majeure event, the EPC Contractor shall be obligated to pay Liquidated Damages pursuant to Section 7, as well as provide such other relief as may be due at law or in equity.\n\n3.17 Extension of Scheduled Completion Date.

If a Force Majeure event causes suspension of the Work, the Scheduled\n\nHanford Mall EPC Agreement - BSU BPi - V2\n\n10\n\nCompletion Date shall be equitably adjusted by Owner and the EPC Contractor taking into account (among other factors) the length of any suspension or delay of the Work caused by such Force Majeure event and the stage of the Work during which such event occurred.\n\n3.18 that the EPC Contractor shall remain liable to Owner for any of the Work so subcontracted.\n\nSubcontractors.

Each subcontractor ultimately approved by the Owner and engaged by the EPC Contractor is hereinafter referred to as a \u201cMajor Subcontractor\u201d and the agreement entered into between the EPC Contractor and a Major Subcontractor shall be referred to as a \u201cMajor Subcontract.\u201d\n\n(b) The EPC Contractor shall require that all Major Subcontract proposals include the\n\nfollowing:\n\n(i)\n\nthe subcontractor candidate\u2019s understanding of the Major Subcontract scope of work;\n\n(ii)\n\nidentification of any potential constructability issues discovered in the subcontractor candidate\u2019s preparation of its proposal;\n\n(iii)\n\nidentification of any assumptions made by the subcontractor candidate in preparing its proposal;\n\n(iv)\n\nan estimated cost of the portion of the Work to be performed under the Major Subcontract; and\n\n(v)\n\napplicable certificates of insurance naming Owner and Host as additional insureds.\n\n(c) Subcontractor proposals shall be transmitted in writing to the Owner either (i) within 30 days of completion of specific design documents relating to the components of the Major Subcontract, if any, or (ii) at least 10 business days prior to commencement of cost negotiations under Section 8.2, whichever is earlier. The EPC Contractor\u2019s transmittal of a set of subcontractor\u2019s proposals shall identify the EPC Contractor\u2019s recommended subcontractor.\n\n(d) Within 10 business days of the EPC Contractor\u2019s transmission of a Subcontractor\n\nproposal, the Owner shall send written notice to the EPC Contractor identifying the approved subcontractor (\u201cMajor Subcontractor\u201d) and the EPC Contractor shall enter into a Major Subcontract with such Major Subcontractor.\n\n(e) The cost estimates included in each Subcontractor proposal are estimates only. EPC\n\nContractor shall require that each Major Subcontractor shall participate in the transparent cost negotiation process set forth in Section 8.3 of this EPC Contract. In its subcontracts, EPC Contractor shall obligate each Subcontractor to work collaboratively with the EPC Contractor and the Owner to deliver the Project within the Owner\u2019s Project Budget.\n\nHanford Mall EPC Agreement - BSU BPi - V2\n\n11\n\nThe EPC Contractor agrees that it will require all subcontractors to perform and complete their portion of the Work in accordance with this EPC Contract and the laws, rules and regulations of all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Work and shall enforce said requirements. The EPC Contractor shall require each subcontractor to assume toward the EPC Contractor all of the obligations and responsibilities which the EPC Contractor assumes to Owner pursuant to this EPC Contract and EPC Contractor shall indemnify Owner for any claims made by a subcontractor against Owner.\n\n3.19 Training. The EPC Contractor will provide Owner's designated operation and maintenance contractor with training services. These services shall take place at the Host Site and shall include the training of up to two (2) people in the operation and maintenance (including health, safety and environmental matters related thereto) of the Project.

The EPC Contractor shall implement and oversee its safety program and shall comply with all health and safety laws, rules and regulations applicable to it. The EPC Contractor shall provide and maintain all such guard lights and other protection for the public as may be required by applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations or by local conditions. EPC Contractor shall develop and shall provide to Owner within 15 days of the date this EPC Contract is executed by the parties hereto an environmental and health and safety program document describing EPC Contractor\u2019s applicable safety measures and shall comply with and shall cause its subcontractors to comply with such measures in the performance of the Work.\n\nSafety. The EPC Contractor shall perform and shall cause the subcontractors to perform the\n\n3.15 No Liens. Provided that Owner shall not be in default due to non-payment, the EPC Contractor shall within ten (10) days of notice pay, dissolve or bond off any lien or encumbrance on the Project, the Host Site, any other Project or equipment located on the Host Site or any component thereof or interest therein by any subcontractor, vendor, or other party claiming by or through EPC Contractor for labor, materials, supplies or other charges which, if unpaid, might be or become a lien upon the Project, the Host Site, or any component thereof. The EPC Contractor shall immediately notify Owner of the assertion of any lien or encumbrance asserted upon the Project, the Host Site, or any component thereof or any interest therein. Upon the failure of the EPC Contractor promptly to pay, dissolve or bond off any lien or encumbrance as required hereby, Owner may pay or bond off such lien or encumbrance and immediately recover the expenses incurred by it in connection with such payment or discharge from the EPC Contractor or set off such expenses against any sums owed by Owner to the EPC Contractor.\n\n3.16 Timely Performance.

If a Force Majeure event causes suspension of the Work, the Scheduled\n\nHanford Mall EPC Agreement - BSU BPi - V2\n\n10\n\nCompletion Date shall be equitably adjusted by Owner and the EPC Contractor taking into account (among other factors) the length of any suspension or delay of the Work caused by such Force Majeure event and the stage of the Work during which such event occurred.\n\n3.18 that the EPC Contractor shall remain liable to Owner for any of the Work so subcontracted.\n\nSubcontractors.

Each subcontractor ultimately approved by the Owner and engaged by the EPC Contractor is hereinafter referred to as a \u201cMajor Subcontractor\u201d and the agreement entered into between the EPC Contractor and a Major Subcontractor shall be referred to as a \u201cMajor Subcontract.\u201d\n\n(b) The EPC Contractor shall require that all Major Subcontract proposals include the\n\nfollowing:\n\n(i)\n\nthe subcontractor candidate\u2019s understanding of the Major Subcontract scope of work;\n\n(ii)\n\nidentification of any potential constructability issues discovered in the subcontractor candidate\u2019s preparation of its proposal;\n\n(iii)\n\nidentification of any assumptions made by the subcontractor candidate in preparing its proposal;\n\n(iv)\n\nan estimated cost of the portion of the Work to be performed under the Major Subcontract; and\n\n(v)\n\napplicable certificates of insurance naming Owner and Host as additional insureds.\n\n(c) Subcontractor proposals shall be transmitted in writing to the Owner either (i) within 30 days of completion of specific design documents relating to the components of the Major Subcontract, if any, or (ii) at least 10 business days prior to commencement of cost negotiations under Section 8.2, whichever is earlier. The EPC Contractor\u2019s transmittal of a set of subcontractor\u2019s proposals shall identify the EPC Contractor\u2019s recommended subcontractor.\n\n(d) Within 10 business days of the EPC Contractor\u2019s transmission of a Subcontractor\n\nproposal, the Owner shall send written notice to the EPC Contractor identifying the approved subcontractor (\u201cMajor Subcontractor\u201d) and the EPC Contractor shall enter into a Major Subcontract with such Major Subcontractor.\n\n(e) The cost estimates included in each Subcontractor proposal are estimates only. EPC\n\nContractor shall require that each Major Subcontractor shall participate in the transparent cost negotiation process set forth in Section 8.3 of this EPC Contract. In its subcontracts, EPC Contractor shall obligate each Subcontractor to work collaboratively with the EPC Contractor and the Owner to deliver the Project within the Owner\u2019s Project Budget.\n\nHanford Mall EPC Agreement - BSU BPi - V2\n\n11\n\nThe EPC Contractor agrees that it will require all subcontractors to perform and complete their portion of the Work in accordance with this EPC Contract and the laws, rules and regulations of all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Work and shall enforce said requirements. The EPC Contractor shall require each subcontractor to assume toward the EPC Contractor all of the obligations and responsibilities which the EPC Contractor assumes to Owner pursuant to this EPC Contract and EPC Contractor shall indemnify Owner for any claims made by a subcontractor against Owner.\n\n3.19 Training.

Upon the sale or transfer of the Project or portion of the Collateral or any other conveyance, transfer or vesting of any direct or indirect interest in the Project or the Collateral, including any encumbrance of the Project or the Collateral, the Loan shall, at Lender\u2019s option in its sole discretion, become immediately due and payable upon notice to Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall be permitted to Transfer the System pursuant to the terms of the PPA or the Site Lease; provided, however, all termination payments or other remuneration received by Borrower from Host pursuant to such Transfer shall be used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under this Agreement as set forth in Section 4.8.\n\n7.2.4 No Additional Debt. Other than the Loan or as set forth in this Agreement, Borrower shall not create, incur, assume, guaranty or suffer to exist any Debt, whether personal or non- recourse, secured or unsecured, subordinate or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent may be withheld in Lender\u2019s sole discretion.\n\n7.2.5 Mechanics\u2019 and Other Liens and the Contest Thereof. Borrower will not suffer or permit any mechanics\u2019 lien, privilege or claim to be filed or otherwise asserted against the Project, and will promptly discharge the same, or cause the same to be discharged, by payment, bonding or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower may contest such lien, privilege or claim in good\n\n19\n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 9441B6D2-D65C-4789-A402-7AB3189AA0C7\n\nfaith and by bona fide proceedings; provided, however, in the event Borrower contests any such mechanics\u2019 lien, privilege or claim, Borrower shall maintain reserves or secure a bond in an amount adequate to pay all contested liabilities in accordance with prudent business practices, which reserves shall not be less than 150% of the amount of the contested liabilities. If Borrower shall fail promptly to discharge any mechanics\u2019 lien(s), privilege(s) or claim(s) filed or otherwise asserted against the Project and totaling at least $25,000 in the aggregate, and provided that Borrower is not contesting the same in good faith, Lender may, at its election (but shall not be obligated to), (a) procure the release and discharge of any such lien, privilege or claim and any judgment or decree thereon, without inquiring into or investigating the amount, validity or enforceability of such lien, privilege or claim and (b) effect any settlement or compromise of the same, and any amounts expended by Lender in connection therewith, including premiums paid or security furnished in connection with the issuance of any surety company bonds, shall be deemed to constitute additional indebtedness evidenced by the Note (even if the total amount of such indebtedness would then exceed the face amount of the Note), payable on demand and secured by the Loan Documents.\n\n7.2.6 Settlement of Claims. Borrower shall not settle or compromise any claim in excess of TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($25,000.00) exclusive of the proceeds of insurance, or consent to entry of any judgment in any action or litigation arising from such a claim, without, in each instance, the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Lender shall determine the application of proceeds from insurance policies, surety bonds, performance guarantees, contractor and vendor penalties, and other similar risk mitigation instruments related to the Project.\n\n7.2.7 Bankruptcy and Insolvency Filings. Borrower shall not file or consent to the filing of any petition under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any similar state or federal law, whether now or hereafter existing, or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become due.\n\n7.2.8 Payments to Affiliates; Cash Distributions; Application of Cash Flow. Neither Borrower nor any Affiliate of Borrower (nor any Affiliates of any such persons or entities) shall receive any overhead fees, management fees, marketing fees, consulting fees (or any fees similar to the foregoing) during the term of the Loan, except to the extent such fees do not exceed the amount that would have been paid to non-affiliated parties for the same services in an arms-length transaction. Borrower must apply all Project Revenues to pay the following items in the following order of priority, to the extent necessary to pay such items: (a) Debt Service; (b) any unpaid Loan Expenses pursuant to Article 5 and all other amounts due to Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents other than Debt Service; (c) any amounts necessary to maintain or replenish the Minimum Payment Reserve Amount; and (d) Operating Expenses, in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to all of the foregoing, so long as no Event of Default remains uncured (or would be caused thereby), Borrower may make payments to its members and Affiliates, in amounts not exceeding the Excess Proceeds. Except as set forth in this Section 7.2.8, no cash distributions or loans shall be made to Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower (or to any Affiliates of any such persons or entities) without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.\n\n7.2.9 Amendments and Modifications to Project Agreements. Without the prior written consent of Lender, in Lender\u2019s reasonable discretion, Borrower shall not materially modify, amend or supplement the EPC Agreement, the O&M Agreement, the Site Lease, the Interconnection Agreement or the PPA or permit any other Party to do the same.\n\nARTICLE 8.\n\nASSIGNMENTS\n\n8.1\n\nAssignments and Participations.

No such assignment shall be deemed the acceptance of the assignee, or a release of Service Provider from the further performance by Service Provider of its\n\n4- 4848-988 1-1966.5\n\nobligations under this Agreement. Any assignment or sublease consented to by Applicant shall not relieve Service Provider (or its assignee or subtenant) from obtaining Applicant's consent to any subsequent assignment or sublease. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Service Provider shall have the right, without the necessity of obtaining Applicant's consent but upon at least thirty (30) days\u2019 prior notice, to assign this Agreement (i) to the parent, a wholly owned subsidiary or an affiliate of Service Provider, or in the event of (ii) a merger or consolidation of Service Provider and another corporation or legal entity, or (iii) a sale of all or substantially all of the stock, or assets of Service Provider; provided that (A) Service Provider is not in default under this Agreement or the Lease beyond any applicable cure period, (B) the assignee's primary business is the providing of solar energy and administration of virtual net metering in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SCE NEMV Schedule and consistent with the prudent industry practice, (C) the assignee assumes in writing the full obligations on the part of the Service Provider under this Agreement and on the part of the lessee under the Lease, and (D) the assignee is of good credit and reputation in the business community and shall have a net worth of at least that of Service Provider as of the date of this Agreement and otherwise sufficient to perform the obligations of Service Provider hereunder (as determined by Applicant), provided that in determining the net worth of the assignee the fair market value of the REGS and any other assets of the assignee shall be taken into account. Upon Service Provider's submission of a request for Applicant's consent to any such transfer, Service Provider shall pay the applicable standard processing fee and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in connection with the proposed transfer, which the parties hereby stipulate to be One Thousand Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($1,500.00), unless Applicant provides to Service Provider evidence that Applicant has incurred greater costs in connection with the proposed transfer. Applicant shall have no liability to Service Provider or to any proposed transferee for damages if it is adjudicated that Applicant's consent has been unreasonably withheld and such unreasonable withholding of consent constitutes a breach of this Agreement or other duty to Service Provider, the proposed transferee or any other person on the part of Service Provider. In such event, Service Provider's sole remedy shall be to have the proposed transfer declared valid as if Applicant's consent had been duly and timely given (although Service Provider shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees if it is determined to be the prevailing party in such litigation). Service Provider hereby specifically waives its rights under California Civil Code Section 1995.310 (and any successor provision) and agrees that the rights of Service Provider for failure of Applicant to consent to a transfer shall be governed by this Section 13(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may not be assigned by Service Provider pursuant to the foregoing without concurrently assigning its rights and obligations as lessee under the Lease to the same assignee as permitted under the Lease.\n\n(c) Assignment/Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and with specific reference to Section 13(b) above, Service Provider shall be permitted to assign this Agreement and/or the Renewable Electrical Generation Facility as collateral security in connection with any financing of the Renewable Electrical Generation Facility, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit H of the Lease (Exhibit H of the Lease is hereby incorporated herein by reference, provided that the Parties agree that for purposes of this Agreement, all references in Exhibit H to (i) \"Landlord\" shall be deemed to be to \"Applicant\"; (ii) all references to \"Lessee\" shall be deemed to be to \"Service Provider\"; and (iii) all references to the \"Lease\" shall be deemed to be to this \"Agreement\").

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein or in Exhibit H of the Lease, Applicant shall not be required to subject its fee estate and interest in the Leased Rooftop Premises or any portion of the Property to the lien of any leasehold financing or mortgage sought or obtained by Service Provider.\n\n14. The Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement by prompt negotiations noticed in writing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall be permitted to Transfer the System pursuant to the terms of the PPA or the Site Lease; provided, however, all termination payments or other remuneration received by Borrower from Host pursuant to such Transfer shall be used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under this Agreement as set forth in Section 4.8.\n\n7.2.4 No Additional Debt. Other than the Loan or as set forth in this Agreement, Borrower shall not create, incur, assume, guaranty or suffer to exist any Debt, whether personal or non- recourse, secured or unsecured, subordinate or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent may be withheld in Lender\u2019s sole discretion.\n\n7.2.5 Mechanics\u2019 and Other Liens and the Contest Thereof. Borrower will not suffer or permit any mechanics\u2019 lien, privilege or claim to be filed or otherwise asserted against the Project, and will promptly discharge the same, or cause the same to be discharged, by payment, bonding or otherwise.

If Borrower shall fail promptly to discharge any mechanics\u2019 lien(s), privilege(s) or claim(s) filed or otherwise asserted against the Project and totaling at least $25,000 in the aggregate, and provided that Borrower is not contesting the same in good faith, Lender may, at its election (but shall not be obligated to), (a) procure the release and discharge of any such lien, privilege or claim and any judgment or decree thereon, without inquiring into or investigating the amount, validity or enforceability of such lien, privilege or claim and (b) effect any settlement or compromise of the same, and any amounts expended by Lender in connection therewith, including premiums paid or security furnished in connection with the issuance of any surety company bonds, shall be deemed to constitute additional indebtedness evidenced by the Note (even if the total amount of such indebtedness would then exceed the face amount of the Note), payable on demand and secured by the Loan Documents.\n\n7.2.6 Settlement of Claims. Borrower shall not settle or compromise any claim in excess of TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($25,000.00) exclusive of the proceeds of insurance, or consent to entry of any judgment in any action or litigation arising from such a claim, without, in each instance, the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

The EPC Contractor\u2019s transmittal of a set of subcontractor\u2019s proposals shall identify the EPC Contractor\u2019s recommended subcontractor.\n\n(d) Within 10 business days of the EPC Contractor\u2019s transmission of a Subcontractor\n\nproposal, the Owner shall send written notice to the EPC Contractor identifying the approved subcontractor (\u201cMajor Subcontractor\u201d) and the EPC Contractor shall enter into a Major Subcontract with such Major Subcontractor.\n\n(e) The cost estimates included in each Subcontractor proposal are estimates only. EPC\n\nContractor shall require that each Major Subcontractor shall participate in the transparent cost negotiation process set forth in Section 8.3 of this EPC Contract. In its subcontracts, EPC Contractor shall obligate each Subcontractor to work collaboratively with the EPC Contractor and the Owner to deliver the Project within the Owner\u2019s Project Budget.\n\nHanford Mall EPC Agreement - BSU BPi - V2\n\n11\n\nThe EPC Contractor agrees that it will require all subcontractors to perform and complete their portion of the Work in accordance with this EPC Contract and the laws, rules and regulations of all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Work and shall enforce said requirements.

The EPC Contractor shall implement and oversee its safety program and shall comply with all health and safety laws, rules and regulations applicable to it. The EPC Contractor shall provide and maintain all such guard lights and other protection for the public as may be required by applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations or by local conditions. EPC Contractor shall develop and shall provide to Owner within 15 days of the date this EPC Contract is executed by the parties hereto an environmental and health and safety program document describing EPC Contractor\u2019s applicable safety measures and shall comply with and shall cause its subcontractors to comply with such measures in the performance of the Work.\n\nSafety. The EPC Contractor shall perform and shall cause the subcontractors to perform the\n\n3.15 No Liens. Provided that Owner shall not be in default due to non-payment, the EPC Contractor shall within ten (10) days of notice pay, dissolve or bond off any lien or encumbrance on the Project, the Host Site, any other Project or equipment located on the Host Site or any component thereof or interest therein by any subcontractor, vendor, or other party claiming by or through EPC Contractor for labor, materials, supplies or other charges which, if unpaid, might be or become a lien upon the Project, the Host Site, or any component thereof. The EPC Contractor shall immediately notify Owner of the assertion of any lien or encumbrance asserted upon the Project, the Host Site, or any component thereof or any interest therein. Upon the failure of the EPC Contractor promptly to pay, dissolve or bond off any lien or encumbrance as required hereby, Owner may pay or bond off such lien or encumbrance and immediately recover the expenses incurred by it in connection with such payment or discharge from the EPC Contractor or set off such expenses against any sums owed by Owner to the EPC Contractor.\n\n3.16 Timely Performance.

If a Force Majeure event causes suspension of the Work, the Scheduled\n\nHanford Mall EPC Agreement - BSU BPi - V2\n\n10\n\nCompletion Date shall be equitably adjusted by Owner and the EPC Contractor taking into account (among other factors) the length of any suspension or delay of the Work caused by such Force Majeure event and the stage of the Work during which such event occurred.\n\n3.18 that the EPC Contractor shall remain liable to Owner for any of the Work so subcontracted.\n\nSubcontractors.

Each subcontractor ultimately approved by the Owner and engaged by the EPC Contractor is hereinafter referred to as a \u201cMajor Subcontractor\u201d and the agreement entered into between the EPC Contractor and a Major Subcontractor shall be referred to as a \u201cMajor Subcontract.\u201d\n\n(b) The EPC Contractor shall require that all Major Subcontract proposals include the\n\nfollowing:\n\n(i)\n\nthe subcontractor candidate\u2019s understanding of the Major Subcontract scope of work;\n\n(ii)\n\nidentification of any potential constructability issues discovered in the subcontractor candidate\u2019s preparation of its proposal;\n\n(iii)\n\nidentification of any assumptions made by the subcontractor candidate in preparing its proposal;\n\n(iv)\n\nan estimated cost of the portion of the Work to be performed under the Major Subcontract; and\n\n(v)\n\napplicable certificates of insurance naming Owner and Host as additional insureds.\n\n(c) Subcontractor proposals shall be transmitted in writing to the Owner either (i) within 30 days of completion of specific design documents relating to the components of the Major Subcontract, if any, or (ii) at least 10 business days prior to commencement of cost negotiations under Section 8.2, whichever is earlier. The EPC Contractor\u2019s transmittal of a set of subcontractor\u2019s proposals shall identify the EPC Contractor\u2019s recommended subcontractor.\n\n(d) Within 10 business days of the EPC Contractor\u2019s transmission of a Subcontractor\n\nproposal, the Owner shall send written notice to the EPC Contractor identifying the approved subcontractor (\u201cMajor Subcontractor\u201d) and the EPC Contractor shall enter into a Major Subcontract with such Major Subcontractor.\n\n(e) The cost estimates included in each Subcontractor proposal are estimates only. EPC\n\nContractor shall require that each Major Subcontractor shall participate in the transparent cost negotiation process set forth in Section 8.3 of this EPC Contract. In its subcontracts, EPC Contractor shall obligate each Subcontractor to work collaboratively with the EPC Contractor and the Owner to deliver the Project within the Owner\u2019s Project Budget.\n\nHanford Mall EPC Agreement - BSU BPi - V2\n\n11\n\nThe EPC Contractor agrees that it will require all subcontractors to perform and complete their portion of the Work in accordance with this EPC Contract and the laws, rules and regulations of all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Work and shall enforce said requirements. The EPC Contractor shall require each subcontractor to assume toward the EPC Contractor all of the obligations and responsibilities which the EPC Contractor assumes to Owner pursuant to this EPC Contract and EPC Contractor shall indemnify Owner for any claims made by a subcontractor against Owner.\n\n3.19 Training.

These services shall take place at the Host Site and shall include the training of up to two (2) people in the operation and maintenance (including health, safety and environmental matters related thereto) of the Project.

Upon the sale or transfer of the Project or portion of the Collateral or any other conveyance, transfer or vesting of any direct or indirect interest in the Project or the Collateral, including any encumbrance of the Project or the Collateral, the Loan shall, at Lender\u2019s option in its sole discretion, become immediately due and payable upon notice to Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall be permitted to Transfer the System pursuant to the terms of the PPA or the Site Lease; provided, however, all termination payments or other remuneration received by Borrower from Host pursuant to such Transfer shall be used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under this Agreement as set forth in Section 4.8.\n\n7.2.4 No Additional Debt. Other than the Loan or as set forth in this Agreement, Borrower shall not create, incur, assume, guaranty or suffer to exist any Debt, whether personal or non- recourse, secured or unsecured, subordinate or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent may be withheld in Lender\u2019s sole discretion.\n\n7.2.5 Mechanics\u2019 and Other Liens and the Contest Thereof. Borrower will not suffer or permit any mechanics\u2019 lien, privilege or claim to be filed or otherwise asserted against the Project, and will promptly discharge the same, or cause the same to be discharged, by payment, bonding or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower may contest such lien, privilege or claim in good\n\n19\n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 9441B6D2-D65C-4789-A402-7AB3189AA0C7\n\nfaith and by bona fide proceedings; provided, however, in the event Borrower contests any such mechanics\u2019 lien, privilege or claim, Borrower shall maintain reserves or secure a bond in an amount adequate to pay all contested liabilities in accordance with prudent business practices, which reserves shall not be less than 150% of the amount of the contested liabilities. If Borrower shall fail promptly to discharge any mechanics\u2019 lien(s), privilege(s) or claim(s) filed or otherwise asserted against the Project and totaling at least $25,000 in the aggregate, and provided that Borrower is not contesting the same in good faith, Lender may, at its election (but shall not be obligated to), (a) procure the release and discharge of any such lien, privilege or claim and any judgment or decree thereon, without inquiring into or investigating the amount, validity or enforceability of such lien, privilege or claim and (b) effect any settlement or compromise of the same, and any amounts expended by Lender in connection therewith, including premiums paid or security furnished in connection with the issuance of any surety company bonds, shall be deemed to constitute additional indebtedness evidenced by the Note (even if the total amount of such indebtedness would then exceed the face amount of the Note), payable on demand and secured by the Loan Documents.\n\n7.2.6 Settlement of Claims. Borrower shall not settle or compromise any claim in excess of TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($25,000.00) exclusive of the proceeds of insurance, or consent to entry of any judgment in any action or litigation arising from such a claim, without, in each instance, the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Lender shall determine the application of proceeds from insurance policies, surety bonds, performance guarantees, contractor and vendor penalties, and other similar risk mitigation instruments related to the Project.\n\n7.2.7 Bankruptcy and Insolvency Filings. Borrower shall not file or consent to the filing of any petition under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any similar state or federal law, whether now or hereafter existing, or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become due.\n\n7.2.8 Payments to Affiliates; Cash Distributions; Application of Cash Flow. Neither Borrower nor any Affiliate of Borrower (nor any Affiliates of any such persons or entities) shall receive any overhead fees, management fees, marketing fees, consulting fees (or any fees similar to the foregoing) during the term of the Loan, except to the extent such fees do not exceed the amount that would have been paid to non-affiliated parties for the same services in an arms-length transaction. Borrower must apply all Project Revenues to pay the following items in the following order of priority, to the extent necessary to pay such items: (a) Debt Service; (b) any unpaid Loan Expenses pursuant to Article 5 and all other amounts due to Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents other than Debt Service; (c) any amounts necessary to maintain or replenish the Minimum Payment Reserve Amount; and (d) Operating Expenses, in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to all of the foregoing, so long as no Event of Default remains uncured (or would be caused thereby), Borrower may make payments to its members and Affiliates, in amounts not exceeding the Excess Proceeds. Except as set forth in this Section 7.2.8, no cash distributions or loans shall be made to Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower (or to any Affiliates of any such persons or entities) without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.\n\n7.2.9 Amendments and Modifications to Project Agreements. Without the prior written consent of Lender, in Lender\u2019s reasonable discretion, Borrower shall not materially modify, amend or supplement the EPC Agreement, the O&M Agreement, the Site Lease, the Interconnection Agreement or the PPA or permit any other Party to do the same.\n\nARTICLE 8.\n\nASSIGNMENTS\n\n8.1\n\nAssignments and Participations.

No such assignment shall be deemed the acceptance of the assignee, or a release of Service Provider from the further performance by Service Provider of its\n\n4- 4848-988 1-1966.5\n\nobligations under this Agreement. Any assignment or sublease consented to by Applicant shall not relieve Service Provider (or its assignee or subtenant) from obtaining Applicant's consent to any subsequent assignment or sublease. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Service Provider shall have the right, without the necessity of obtaining Applicant's consent but upon at least thirty (30) days\u2019 prior notice, to assign this Agreement (i) to the parent, a wholly owned subsidiary or an affiliate of Service Provider, or in the event of (ii) a merger or consolidation of Service Provider and another corporation or legal entity, or (iii) a sale of all or substantially all of the stock, or assets of Service Provider; provided that (A) Service Provider is not in default under this Agreement or the Lease beyond any applicable cure period, (B) the assignee's primary business is the providing of solar energy and administration of virtual net metering in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SCE NEMV Schedule and consistent with the prudent industry practice, (C) the assignee assumes in writing the full obligations on the part of the Service Provider under this Agreement and on the part of the lessee under the Lease, and (D) the assignee is of good credit and reputation in the business community and shall have a net worth of at least that of Service Provider as of the date of this Agreement and otherwise sufficient to perform the obligations of Service Provider hereunder (as determined by Applicant), provided that in determining the net worth of the assignee the fair market value of the REGS and any other assets of the assignee shall be taken into account. Upon Service Provider's submission of a request for Applicant's consent to any such transfer, Service Provider shall pay the applicable standard processing fee and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in connection with the proposed transfer, which the parties hereby stipulate to be One Thousand Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($1,500.00), unless Applicant provides to Service Provider evidence that Applicant has incurred greater costs in connection with the proposed transfer. Applicant shall have no liability to Service Provider or to any proposed transferee for damages if it is adjudicated that Applicant's consent has been unreasonably withheld and such unreasonable withholding of consent constitutes a breach of this Agreement or other duty to Service Provider, the proposed transferee or any other person on the part of Service Provider. In such event, Service Provider's sole remedy shall be to have the proposed transfer declared valid as if Applicant's consent had been duly and timely given (although Service Provider shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees if it is determined to be the prevailing party in such litigation). Service Provider hereby specifically waives its rights under California Civil Code Section 1995.310 (and any successor provision) and agrees that the rights of Service Provider for failure of Applicant to consent to a transfer shall be governed by this Section 13(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may not be assigned by Service Provider pursuant to the foregoing without concurrently assigning its rights and obligations as lessee under the Lease to the same assignee as permitted under the Lease.\n\n(c) Assignment/Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and with specific reference to Section 13(b) above, Service Provider shall be permitted to assign this Agreement and/or the Renewable Electrical Generation Facility as collateral security in connection with any financing of the Renewable Electrical Generation Facility, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit H of the Lease (Exhibit H of the Lease is hereby incorporated herein by reference, provided that the Parties agree that for purposes of this Agreement, all references in Exhibit H to (i) \"Landlord\" shall be deemed to be to \"Applicant\"; (ii) all references to \"Lessee\" shall be deemed to be to \"Service Provider\"; and (iii) all references to the \"Lease\" shall be deemed to be to this \"Agreement\"). In the event Service Provider obtains such financing, Service Provider shall notify Applicant of the identity\n\n5- 4848-988 | -1966.5\n\nof any such financing party and the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit H of the Lease shall apply with respect thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein or in Exhibit H of the Lease, Applicant shall not be required to subject its fee estate and interest in the Leased Rooftop Premises or any portion of the Property to the lien of any leasehold financing or mortgage sought or obtained by Service Provider.\n\n14. The Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement by prompt negotiations noticed in writing. The prevailing party in any dispute arising out of this Agreement shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\n\n15.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall be permitted to Transfer the System pursuant to the terms of the PPA or the Site Lease; provided, however, all termination payments or other remuneration received by Borrower from Host pursuant to such Transfer shall be used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under this Agreement as set forth in Section 4.8.\n\n7.2.4 No Additional Debt. Other than the Loan or as set forth in this Agreement, Borrower shall not create, incur, assume, guaranty or suffer to exist any Debt, whether personal or non- recourse, secured or unsecured, subordinate or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent may be withheld in Lender\u2019s sole discretion.\n\n7.2.5 Mechanics\u2019 and Other Liens and the Contest Thereof. Borrower will not suffer or permit any mechanics\u2019 lien, privilege or claim to be filed or otherwise asserted against the Project, and will promptly discharge the same, or cause the same to be discharged, by payment, bonding or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower may contest such lien, privilege or claim in good\n\n19\n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 9441B6D2-D65C-4789-A402-7AB3189AA0C7\n\nfaith and by bona fide proceedings; provided, however, in the event Borrower contests any such mechanics\u2019 lien, privilege or claim, Borrower shall maintain reserves or secure a bond in an amount adequate to pay all contested liabilities in accordance with prudent business practices, which reserves shall not be less than 150% of the amount of the contested liabilities. If Borrower shall fail promptly to discharge any mechanics\u2019 lien(s), privilege(s) or claim(s) filed or otherwise asserted against the Project and totaling at least $25,000 in the aggregate, and provided that Borrower is not contesting the same in good faith, Lender may, at its election (but shall not be obligated to), (a) procure the release and discharge of any such lien, privilege or claim and any judgment or decree thereon, without inquiring into or investigating the amount, validity or enforceability of such lien, privilege or claim and (b) effect any settlement or compromise of the same, and any amounts expended by Lender in connection therewith, including premiums paid or security furnished in connection with the issuance of any surety company bonds, shall be deemed to constitute additional indebtedness evidenced by the Note (even if the total amount of such indebtedness would then exceed the face amount of the Note), payable on demand and secured by the Loan Documents.\n\n7.2.6 Settlement of Claims. Borrower shall not settle or compromise any claim in excess of TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($25,000.00) exclusive of the proceeds of insurance, or consent to entry of any judgment in any action or litigation arising from such a claim, without, in each instance, the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Lender shall determine the application of proceeds from insurance policies, surety bonds, performance guarantees, contractor and vendor penalties, and other similar risk mitigation instruments related to the Project.\n\n7.2.7 Bankruptcy and Insolvency Filings. Borrower shall not file or consent to the filing of any petition under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any similar state or federal law, whether now or hereafter existing, or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become due.\n\n7.2.8 Payments to Affiliates; Cash Distributions; Application of Cash Flow. Neither Borrower nor any Affiliate of Borrower (nor any Affiliates of any such persons or entities) shall receive any overhead fees, management fees, marketing fees, consulting fees (or any fees similar to the foregoing) during the term of the Loan, except to the extent such fees do not exceed the amount that would have been paid to non-affiliated parties for the same services in an arms-length transaction. Borrower must apply all Project Revenues to pay the following items in the following order of priority, to the extent necessary to pay such items: (a) Debt Service; (b) any unpaid Loan Expenses pursuant to Article 5 and all other amounts due to Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents other than Debt Service; (c) any amounts necessary to maintain or replenish the Minimum Payment Reserve Amount; and (d) Operating Expenses, in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to all of the foregoing, so long as no Event of Default remains uncured (or would be caused thereby), Borrower may make payments to its members and Affiliates, in amounts not exceeding the Excess Proceeds. Except as set forth in this Section 7.2.8, no cash distributions or loans shall be made to Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower (or to any Affiliates of any such persons or entities) without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.\n\n7.2.9 Amendments and Modifications to Project Agreements. Without the prior written consent of Lender, in Lender\u2019s reasonable discretion, Borrower shall not materially modify, amend or supplement the EPC Agreement, the O&M Agreement, the Site Lease, the Interconnection Agreement or the PPA or permit any other Party to do the same.\n\nARTICLE 8.\n\nASSIGNMENTS\n\n8.1\n\nAssignments and Participations.
